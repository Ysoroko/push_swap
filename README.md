# push_swap

### Push_swap is a project about efficiently sorting a list of numbers by using two stacks.

### It is composed of two parts:
- #### ðŸ“¶ "push_swap" executable will accept the numbers as arguments and will display the necessary commands to sort the them.
- #### âœ… "checker" executable will accept the numbers as argments, wait for user's input commands and apply them to the stack of numbers. When stopped it will display "OK"
if the stack is sorted or "KO" if it's not.

### Examples:
